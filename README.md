# Personal Finance Dashboard

A data analytics project with three aims:
- Showcase SQL proficiency across aggregations, joins, CTEs, window functions and data cleaning
- Analyse a large-scale financial transactions dataset covering spending behaviour, error patterns and fraud
- Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard powered directly by SQL queries

## Progress

- Dataset sourced from the [Financial Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets) on Kaggle
- SQLite database built from raw CSVs using `setup_db.py`
- SQL queries written and documented in `sql/queries.sql`
